// Task are asked to design a calorie tracking app, which helps users to:
// Keep a record of their activities.
// Monitor the number of calories they lose when performing the activity.


// Sam decides to do cycling 30 minutes everday for 15 days.
// Cycling for 30 minutes burns 225 calories on average.
// Use console.log to tell Sam how much calories he would lose:
// "Great work, Sam! After 0.5 hours of running everyday for a week, may lose a total calories."

let totCalBurnedPerHour = 450; // since Sam burns calories 225 calories for half hour.
let numDaysCycling = 15; // numbers of days of Sam to do cycling.
let hoursPerDay = 0.5; // total hour/s of Sam daily cycling.

let totalCaloriesBurned = totCalBurnedPerHour * numDaysCycling * hoursPerDay;

console.log(`Great work, Sam! After ${hoursPerDay} hour/s of running eveday for a week,you may lose of ${totalCaloriesBurned} calories.`);
